Developed a robust Blog Management System API using Django and Django REST Framework, featuring role-based authentication to distinguish between admin and regular user access.



Implemented user account features like registration, login, and logout, along with secure profile management, ensuring data privacy through token-based authentication.



Designed a role-based access control system, granting admins full control over all API endpoints while limiting regular users to managing only their own blog posts and comments.



Built a comprehensive blog management module that allows users to create, view, update, and delete blog posts, complete with title, content, publication date, and author details.



Added commenting functionality so users can engage with blog posts by adding, editing, or deleting comments, with strict access controls to ensure users only manage their own content.



Created secure and user-friendly API endpoints for all core operations, requiring authentication for most interactions, except for public actions like registration, login, and logout.
